Is the Grim Reaper Sick In Your State?

The Grim Reaper Project is a research project revolving around CDC data on US Deaths by Pneumonia and Influenza over the past 10 years. 
We used pandas to manipulate the CDC data, as well as census data, in an attempt to identify trends that may be predictive of incidence of death from Pneumonia and influenza.  We also used Matplotlib to visualize our findings and regression analyses.  Our methods and findings were presented to a group of peers in a Data Analytics Bootcamp.  Finally, we created a search function that will take the name of a US state as input and retreive from our dataset the relevant statistics relating to that state.  

Upon it's completion, this project was further developed with interactive visualization here: https://jdb3.github.io/grimreaper.html
